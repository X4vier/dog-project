## Dog-breed Prediction App

![Sample Output][image1]

I completed this project in January 2018 as part of Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree.

In the project I train convolutional neural networks to recognise humans and dogs in images, and classify dogs according to their breed. These networks are used to make an app which, when provided with an image of a dog will try to classify its breed, and when provided with an image of a human will output what breed that person most closely resembles.
